## Description
* This website can be views on both desktop and mobile browsers. Given this website was built on a MacBook, the targeted operating system is iOS. The target browser is Google Chrome (Version 112.0.5615.121), but works similarly on Safari (Version 15.6.1).
* API: Earthquakes (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2020-01-01&endtime=2020-01-02)
* The visualization is a map displaying the magnitude and location of 15 earthquakes at a time.
* The project uses Leafleft.js to create the map. 
* Flexbox was used for the CSS framework. Flexbox is a CSS 3 web layout model. No other CSS frameworks were used.
* This website displays data about earthquakes around the world. The API the visualization is fetching from contains relevant information like distance and direction from nearest city, magnitude, and coordinates of 611 earthquakes. The purpose of this project is to bring awareness of the presence of earthquakes in certain locations. Using the information present in the API, the map can be used to identify the location that has the most amount of earthquakes out of 15 earthquakes at a time. Users will also be able to see, on average, which locations have earthquakes of the highest magnitude and therefore, the most effect on the surrounding area. The map shows the location of 15 earthquakes at a time based off a its coordinate location.
