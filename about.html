            <h3>Overview</h3>
            This website displays data about earthquakes around the world. The API the 
            visualization is fetching from contains relevant information like distance 
            and direction from nearest city, magnitude, and coordinates of 611 
            earthquakes. The problem I'm trying to solve is lack of awareness of the 
            presence of earthquakes in certain locations. Using the information present 
            in the API, the map will be able to identify the location of the most amount 
            of earthquakes from a set of 15 at a time. You will also be able to see, on 
            average, which locations have the highest magnitude earthquakes and therefore, 
            the most effect on the surrounding area.

            <h3>How To Use Visualization</h3>
            The map shows the location of 15 earthquakes at a time based off a 
            its coordinate location. First, you want generate an initial list of
            earthquakes by clicking the generate button. Then, you can filter 
            through the generated list of earthquakes by typing in the magnitude
            or location of earthquakes. To generate a new list of earthquakes after
            the original list is generated, use the refresh button that appears.
